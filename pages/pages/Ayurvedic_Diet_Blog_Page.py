    Welcome to our guide on the <span class="highlight">Ayurvedic Diet</span>, where we explore how eating according to your dosha can enhance your health and well-being. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet tailored to your individual constitution. Let's dive into the world of doshas and discover the best dietary practices for each type.

    st.markdown("""
    In Ayurveda, doshas are the fundamental energies that govern our physical and mental processes. There are three primary doshas:
    - **Vata** (Air and Ether): Governs movement, circulation, and communication.
    - **Pitta** (Fire and Water): Controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
    - **Kapha** (Earth and Water): Provides structure, lubrication, and stability.
    
    Each person has a unique combination of these doshas, which influences their physical and mental characteristics. Imbalances in doshas can lead to health issues, and diet is a key factor in maintaining balance.

    Here are some tips to help you incorporate Ayurvedic dietary practices into your daily life:
    - **Eat Mindfully:** Pay attention to your food, chew slowly, and enjoy the flavors.
    - **Follow a Routine:** Eat at regular times each day to support your digestive health.
    - **Balance Tastes:** Ensure your meals include all six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent, with an emphasis on the tastes that balance your dosha.
    - **Stay Hydrated:** Drink warm water or herbal teas throughout the day.
    - **Seasonal Eating:** Adjust your diet according to the seasons, as each season affects the doshas differently.
